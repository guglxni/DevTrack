CANNOT_DO (1): {cannot_do_desc}\n2. WITH_SUPPORT (3): {with_support_desc}\n3. EMERGING (5): {emerging_desc}\n4. INDEPENDENT (7): {independent_desc}\n5. LOST_SKILL (2): {lost_skill_desc}\n\nIMPORTANT: For infants (0-12 months), development is rapid and variable. Consider that:\n- Skills often emerge suddenly and may appear inconsistent at first\n- Physical support and positioning significantly impact skill demonstration\n- Environmental context strongly influences infant behavior\n- Caregiver reports are essential due to limited observation windows\n\nProvide your assessment as a single score (1-7) and a brief explanation that references age-appropriate expectations.\n\nScore (1-7):",
  "age_guidance": "Key considerations for {age_months}-month-old infants:\n- Development shows wide individual variation but relatively consistent sequence\n- Assessment should account for adjusted age if child was premature\n- Typical milestones at this age include: {age_appropriate_skills}\n- Variability in timing of skill emergence is normal and expected",

    "cannot_do_desc": "Infant shows no precursors or attempts of the skill despite appropriate opportunities",
    "with_support_desc": "Infant demonstrates elements of the skill with physical assistance or optimal positioning",

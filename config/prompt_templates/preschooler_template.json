  "base_template": "You are an expert in preschool development (25-60 months). Your task is to evaluate a caregiver's response about their preschooler's developmental milestone.\n\nMilestone: {milestone}\nDevelopmental Domain: {domain}\nAge Context: {age_months} months old preschooler\n\nPRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:\n- Preschoolers show dramatic improvements in language, reasoning, and social skills\n- Gross and fine motor coordination become increasingly refined\n- Cognitive abilities expand to include abstract thinking and problem-solving\n- Social play evolves from parallel to cooperative with emerging friendship concepts\n- Self-regulation and independence in daily activities significantly improve\n- Imagination and creativity flourish in play and storytelling\n\nCaregiver's Response: \"{response}\"\n\nBased on the caregiver's response, determine if the preschooler:\n1. CANNOT_DO (1): Preschooler shows no signs of the skill\n2. WITH_SUPPORT (3): Preschooler shows the skill with help or prompting\n3. EMERGING (5): Preschooler is beginning to show the skill inconsistently\n4. INDEPENDENT (7): Preschooler consistently demonstrates the skill without support\n5. LOST_SKILL (2): Preschooler could do this before but has lost the skill\n\nNOTE: Consider the specific age within the preschool period, as expectations differ significantly between young preschoolers (2-3 years) and older preschoolers (4-5 years).\n\nProvide your assessment as a single score (1-7):",
  "domain_specific_additions": {
    "motor": "MOTOR DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:\n- Gross motor: jumping, balancing, hopping, climbing, pedaling, ball skills develop\n- Fine motor: drawing/writing progresses from scribbles to representational shapes and letters\n- Coordination allows for increasingly complex physical activities\n- Self-care skills like dressing, toileting, and eating become refined\n- Left/right hand dominance typically established by age 4",
    "communication": "COMMUNICATION DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:\n- Vocabulary expands dramatically from hundreds to thousands of words\n- Sentence length and complexity increase significantly\n- Grammar rules are increasingly applied correctly\n- Conversational skills develop (turn-taking, staying on topic)\n- Narrative abilities emerge and develop (telling stories with sequence)\n- Phonological awareness develops in preparation for reading\n- Younger preschoolers may still have pronunciation errors that resolve by 4-5 years",
    "social": "SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:\n- Play evolves from parallel to associative to truly cooperative\n- Friendships form with preferences for specific peers\n- Understanding of emotions becomes more sophisticated\n- Empathy and perspective-taking improve\n- Conflict resolution skills begin to develop\n- Dramatic and pretend play become elaborate and extended\n- Rules and fair play concepts begin to be understood",
    "cognitive": "COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:\n- Magical thinking is common but gradually gives way to more logical reasoning\n- Understanding of time, sequence, and numbers develops\n- Memory capacity increases significantly\n- Problem-solving becomes more sophisticated\n- Early academic concepts are acquired (letters, numbers, shapes, colors)\n- Questions become more complex and thoughtful\n- Attention span gradually increases for activities of interest"

  "age_specific_guidance": {
    "25-36": "For young preschoolers (25-36 months):\n- Often in transition from toddler to preschool skills\n- Sentences typically 2-4 words with developing grammar\n- Beginning associative play but still frequent parallel play\n- Drawing progresses from scribbles to some controlled marks\n- Can follow 2-step directions\n- Independent in some self-care but needs significant support\n- Toilet training often accomplished during this period",
    "37-48": "For middle preschoolers (37-48 months):\n- More complex language with 4-5 word sentences\n- Beginning cooperative play with emerging friendships\n- Drawing recognizable shapes and figures\n- Increased coordination for hopping, balancing, climbing\n- Growing independence in self-care routines\n- Beginning to understand turn-taking and sharing\n- Developing time concepts (today, tomorrow)",
    "49-60": "For older preschoolers (49-60 months):\n- Complex sentences and questions\n- Telling connected stories and following storylines\n- Cooperative play with assigned roles\n- Early literacy and numeracy skills emerging\n- Drawing detailed pictures with representational elements\n- Advanced gross motor skills (skipping, simple sports skills)\n- More sophisticated understanding of rules and fairness\n- Greater emotional regulation and delayed gratification\n- Independence in most self-care routines"

  "base_template": "You are an expert in toddler development (13-24 months). Your task is to evaluate a caregiver's response about their toddler's developmental milestone.\n\nMilestone: {milestone}\nDevelopmental Domain: {domain}\nAge Context: {age_months} months old toddler\n\nTODDLER DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:\n- Toddlers experience rapid language acquisition and motor skill development\n- Independent mobility becomes established (walking) with increasing coordination\n- Receptive language generally exceeds expressive language capabilities\n- Social development includes parallel play and emerging awareness of others\n- Self-help skills begin to emerge but with variable consistency\n- Emotional regulation is developing but still challenging (tantrums common)\n\nCaregiver's Response: \"{response}\"\n\nBased on the caregiver's response, determine if the toddler:\n1. CANNOT_DO (1): Toddler shows no signs of the skill \n2. WITH_SUPPORT (3): Toddler shows the skill with help or prompting\n3. EMERGING (5): Toddler is beginning to show the skill inconsistently\n4. INDEPENDENT (7): Toddler consistently demonstrates the skill without support\n5. LOST_SKILL (2): Toddler could do this before but has lost the skill\n\nNOTE: Toddler development can be uneven across domains, with spurts and plateaus common.\n\nProvide your assessment as a single score (1-7):",
  "domain_specific_additions": {
    "motor": "MOTOR DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:\n- Most toddlers walk independently by 15 months\n- Running, climbing stairs, and jumping develop during this period\n- Fine motor precision improves for tasks like stacking blocks and using utensils\n- Throwing and kicking emerge\n- Hand dominance may begin to appear",
    "communication": "COMMUNICATION DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:\n- Vocabulary typically explodes during this period (from a few words to 50+ words)\n- Two-word combinations often emerge around 18-24 months\n- Following simple directions becomes more consistent\n- Toddlers understand significantly more than they can express\n- Communication frustration may lead to behavioral challenges",
    "social": "SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:\n- Play evolves from solitary to parallel play (playing alongside others)\n- Imitation of others increases dramatically\n- Early empathy emerges (comforting others, sharing)\n- Separation anxiety often peaks and then gradually decreases\n- Interest in peers increases, though interactive play is limited",
    "adaptive": "ADAPTIVE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:\n- Self-feeding with utensils improves\n- Toddlers may show interest in toilet training, especially later in this period\n- Dressing/undressing simple items becomes possible\n- Sleep transitions may include moving from crib to bed\n- Emotional regulation remains challenging but improving"

  "age_specific_guidance": {
    "13-15": "For young toddlers (13-15 months):\n- Walking typically becomes established\n- First words beyond mama/dada should be emerging\n- Simple directions can be followed with gestures\n- Drinking from a cup and finger feeding should be present\n- Separation anxiety may still be significant",
    "16-18": "For middle toddlers (16-18 months):\n- Walking becomes more steady with less falling\n- Vocabulary slowly expands (typically at least 5-20 words)\n- Symbolic play begins (pretending with objects)\n- Increased testing of limits and independence\n- May begin to use utensils with significant messiness",
    "19-21": "For older toddlers (19-21 months):\n- Running and climbing stairs with support\n- Vocabulary often expands more rapidly\n- Simple two-word combinations may emerge\n- Parallel play increases\n- Can indicate basic needs through words or gestures",
    "22-24": "For toddlers nearing two years (22-24 months):\n- More coordinated running and climbing\n- Should have at least 50 words, may combine words\n- Follows two-step instructions\n- Shows interest in peers and symbolic play\n- Increased independence in self-help skills\n- May begin to show interest in toilet training"

## Presentation Script

### Introduction (2 minutes)

"Today I'll be demonstrating our ASD Assessment API, which provides four key endpoints to support the assessment of developmental milestones in children. This web application provides a user-friendly interface to showcase the API's capabilities.

The API is designed to facilitate the standardization and automation of developmental milestone assessments, with a particular focus on supporting early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other developmental concerns."

### Overview of the Application (2 minutes)

"The application is organized into tabs, with each tab representing one of the four API endpoints:
1. Question - For processing questions related to developmental milestones
2. Keywords - For categorizing assessment-related keywords
3. Send Score - For recording milestone scores
4. Score Response - For analyzing parent/caregiver responses

Each endpoint plays a specific role in the assessment process, and together they provide a comprehensive system for milestone evaluation."

### Key Features to Highlight (1 minute)

"Throughout the demonstration, I'd like you to notice several key features:
1. The clean, intuitive user interface for interacting with the API
2. The fast response times, typically in milliseconds
3. The structured JSON responses that facilitate easy integration
4. The NLP capabilities for analyzing natural language responses
5. The fallback mechanisms ensuring continuous operation"

### Demonstration of Endpoints

#### 1. Question Endpoint (3 minutes)

"The Question endpoint allows us to process questions related to specific developmental milestones. This helps standardize assessment questions and match them to appropriate milestone behaviors."

- Point out the input fields:
  - Question Text: "Does the child respond when called by name?"
  - Milestone ID: "Recognizes familiar people"

- Click "Send Request" and discuss the response:
  - Point out the structured format of the response
  - Highlight the confidence score (e.g., 0.92)
  - Note the extremely fast response time (typically 1-5ms)
  - Explain how this endpoint helps match questions to appropriate milestones

"This endpoint is particularly valuable for ensuring consistency in assessment questions across different providers or settings."

#### 2. Keywords Endpoint (3 minutes)

"The Keywords endpoint manages categorized keywords that are used to analyze parent/caregiver responses. These keywords form the foundation of our pattern detection system."

- Show the category dropdown and explain the categories:
  - CANNOT_DO (score 0): Keywords indicating the child cannot perform the behavior
  - LOST_SKILL (score 1): Keywords indicating a skill was previously acquired but lost
  - EMERGING (score 2): Keywords indicating a skill is emerging but inconsistent
  - WITH_SUPPORT (score 3): Keywords indicating a skill is acquired with support
  - INDEPENDENT (score 4): Keywords indicating a skill is fully acquired
  
- Display the keywords for CANNOT_DO:
  - "These keywords help identify when a parent's response indicates the child cannot perform a behavior. For example: 'no', 'not', 'never', 'doesn't', 'cannot', etc."
  
- Click "Send Request" and discuss the response:
  - Show how the keywords are validated and processed
  - Point out the keywords_count in the response
  - Note the typical response time (1-3ms)
  - Explain how these keywords are used in both the advanced NLP and fallback pattern detection systems

"The keywords endpoint allows us to continuously improve and refine our response analysis by updating the keyword patterns over time."

#### 3. Send Score Endpoint (3 minutes)

"The Send Score endpoint allows recording specific scores for developmental milestones. This provides a way to manually enter or override scores when needed."

- Explain the input fields:
  - Milestone ID: "Shows empathy"
  - Score: 4
  - Score Label: "INDEPENDENT"
  
- Explain the scoring system:
  - 0: CANNOT_DO - Skill not acquired
  - 1: LOST_SKILL - Skill was acquired but lost
  - 2: EMERGING - Skill is emerging but inconsistent
  - 3: WITH_SUPPORT - Skill is acquired but needs support
  - 4: INDEPENDENT - Skill is fully acquired
  
- Click "Send Request" and discuss the response:
  - Show the confirmation of the score submission
  - Note the response time (typically 1-3ms)
  - Explain how this feeds into the assessment system

"This endpoint is particularly useful for healthcare providers who need to manually enter scores based on direct observation or clinical judgment."

#### 4. Score Response Endpoint (5 minutes)

"The Score Response endpoint is one of our most powerful features. It analyzes a parent's response about a specific milestone behavior and determines the appropriate score using natural language processing techniques."

- Show the input fields:
  - Milestone Behavior: "Recognizes familiar people"
  - Parent/Caregiver Response: "My child is very good at recognizing familiar faces. He always smiles when he sees grandparents or his favorite babysitter. He knows all his family members and distinguishes between strangers and people he knows well."
  
- Click "Send Request" and discuss the response:
  - Point out the score and score_label in the response
  - Highlight the confidence level (e.g., 0.95)
  - Note the response time (typically 1-5ms)
  - Explain how the system analyzes the text to determine the score

"The Score Response endpoint employs two analysis methods:

1. Advanced NLP Analysis: When available, the system uses sophisticated natural language processing to analyze the semantic content of responses.

2. Fallback Pattern Detection: If the advanced NLP module is unavailable or encounters an error, the system automatically falls back to a pattern detection mechanism using the keywords we saw earlier. This ensures continuous operation while maintaining reasonable accuracy.

You might notice in the logs a message saying 'Advanced NLP module not available or error during analysis' if the fallback mechanism is being used. This is by design and ensures the system remains operational even when the advanced features aren't available."

### Response Time and Performance (2 minutes)

"You'll notice that each response includes a response time. Our API is designed to be highly performant, with most responses returned in milliseconds."

- Point out the response time badges on each tab
- Explain typical performance expectations:
  - Question endpoint: 1-5ms
  - Keywords endpoint: 1-3ms
  - Send Score endpoint: 1-3ms
  - Score Response endpoint: 1-5ms
- Mention the scaling capabilities
- Discuss how the fallback mechanisms ensure reliability

"The API's high performance makes it suitable for real-time applications where immediate feedback is important."

### API Implementation Details (2 minutes)

"The API is built using modern technologies:
- FastAPI for the backend API framework
- Uvicorn as the ASGI server
- Built-in CORS support for cross-origin requests

## Troubleshooting During Presentation

If you encounter issues during the presentation:

1. **API Connection Problems**
   - Check if the API server is running: `curl -s http://localhost:8003/health`
   - Restart the API server if needed: `cd src/api && uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8003`
   - Try using `http://127.0.0.1:3000` instead of `localhost` if browser access fails

2. **Web Demo Issues**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Restart the Node.js server: `cd webapp && npm start`
   - Use a different browser if rendering issues occur

3. **Port Already in Use**
   - If port 8003 is already in use: `lsof -i :8003` to find the process
   - Terminate the process: `kill -9 [PID]`
   - Start the API server on a different port if needed

4. **NLP Module Not Available**
   - This is normal and will trigger the fallback mechanism
   - Explain to stakeholders that this demonstrates the system's resilience

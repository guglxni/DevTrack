## Understanding the Results

### Speedup Interpretation

Speedup values represent how many times faster the Metal GPU is compared to CPU-only execution:
- Values > 1: GPU is faster (e.g., 2.5x means GPU is 2.5 times faster)
- Values â‰ˆ 1: GPU and CPU performance is similar
- Values < 1: CPU is faster than GPU (rare, but can happen for small workloads due to overhead)

### Optimal Operations for GPU

Metal GPUs typically excel at:
- Large matrix multiplications (2000x2000 and larger)
- Convolutional operations on larger images
- Neural network forward and backward passes

Small operations may not see significant speedup due to the overhead of transferring data to/from the GPU.

### Memory Usage Patterns

The performance analysis plots show GPU memory usage over time, which can help identify:
- Memory leaks (steadily increasing usage)
- Inefficient memory patterns (frequent spikes)
- Underutilization of GPU resources

## Running New Benchmarks

To run a new set of benchmarks, execute:

```
./run_benchmarks.sh
```

This will create new result files with the current timestamp in this directory.

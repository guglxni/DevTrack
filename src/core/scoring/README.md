# Improved Developmental Milestone Scoring System

This module implements a comprehensive, modular scoring system for developmental milestone assessments. It addresses the limitations of the previous implementation by providing a more robust, explainable, and continuously improving scoring mechanism.

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for flexible composition of scoring components:

```
ImprovedDevelopmentalScoringEngine
├── Component Scorers
│   ├── KeywordBasedScorer
│   ├── SemanticEmbeddingScorer
│   └── TransformerBasedScorer
├── Supporting Systems
│   ├── ConfidenceTracker
│   ├── AuditLogger
│   └── ContinuousLearningEngine
└── API Integration
    └── FastAPI Routes
```

## Key Components

### Scoring Components

1. **KeywordBasedScorer**: Uses pattern matching and regex for basic scoring
2. **SemanticEmbeddingScorer**: Uses sentence embeddings for semantic understanding
3. **TransformerBasedScorer**: Uses transformer models for advanced NLP understanding

### Supporting Systems

1. **ConfidenceTracker**: Tracks confidence in predictions and identifies uncertain cases
2. **AuditLogger**: Logs all scoring decisions for transparency and debugging
3. **ContinuousLearningEngine**: Collects expert feedback to improve the system over time

## Key Improvements

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a clear responsibility and can be developed independently
2. **Explainability**: Detailed reasoning for each scoring decision
3. **Confidence Estimation**: Quantified uncertainty to identify cases needing expert review
4. **Continuous Learning**: Mechanism to incorporate expert feedback and improve over time
5. **Robust Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when components are unavailable
6. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit trail for all scoring decisions

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.core.scoring.improved_engine import ImprovedDevelopmentalScoringEngine

# Initialize the engine
engine = ImprovedDevelopmentalScoringEngine()

# Score a response
result = engine.score_response(
    response="Yes, my child can do this independently",
    milestone_context={
        "id": "social_01",
        "domain": "social",
        "behavior": "Recognize familiar people",
        "criteria": "Child recognizes and shows preference for familiar caregivers"
    }
)

# Print the result
print(f"Score: {result.score.name}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.2f}")
print(f"Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")
```

### Providing Expert Feedback

```python
from src.core.scoring.base import Score

# Provide expert feedback
engine.with_expert_feedback(
    response="Sometimes, but not consistently",
    milestone_context={
        "id": "communication_03",
        "domain": "communication",
        "behavior": "Respond to their name",
        "criteria": "Child looks or turns when their name is called"
    },
    correct_score=Score.EMERGING,
    notes="Child is just beginning to respond to name"
)
```

### API Integration

The system can be integrated with FastAPI using the provided routes:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from src.api.improved_scoring_routes import add_routes_to_app

app = FastAPI()
add_routes_to_app(app)
```

## Configuration

Each component can be configured independently:

```python
engine = ImprovedDevelopmentalScoringEngine({
    "enable_keyword_scorer": True,
    "enable_embedding_scorer": True,
    "enable_transformer_scorer": False,  # Disable for performance
    "enable_continuous_learning": True,
    "score_weights": {
        "keyword": 0.6,
        "embedding": 0.4
    },
    "keyword_scorer": {
        "confidence_threshold": 0.7
    },
    "embedding_scorer": {
        "model_name": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
    }
})
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Fine-tuning Pipeline**: Automated fine-tuning of models with collected data
2. **Active Learning**: Prioritize examples that would most improve the model
3. **Domain Adaptation**: Specialized models for different developmental domains
4. **Multi-language Support**: Extend to support multiple languages
5. **Longitudinal Tracking**: Track development over time

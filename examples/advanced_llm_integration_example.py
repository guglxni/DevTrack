Step 1: Analyze specific behaviors in the parent's response.
The child takes turns playing with blocks with his brother, showing some turn-taking ability.
However, this only occurs with adult reminders, indicating the skill is not internalized.

Step 2: Evaluate consistency and independence level.
The parent uses the word "sometimes" which suggests inconsistent performance.
The phrase "only if I remind him" clearly indicates that adult prompting is required.

Step 3: Consider developmental expectations for this age range (30-36 months).
At this age, children typically begin to understand turn-taking but may need support.
Full independent turn-taking without reminders usually develops closer to 36 months.

Step 4: Assess the nature of the support provided.
The support is verbal reminders from the parent, which is a moderate level of support.
The child can execute the skill when prompted, showing they understand the concept.

Based on these observations, the child demonstrates the skill of taking turns in games but requires verbal prompting from adults to do so consistently. This aligns with the WITH_SUPPORT developmental level.

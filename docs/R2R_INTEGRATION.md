R2R enhances the system with advanced retrieval capabilities for improved developmental assessment scoring and knowledge management.

> **Status: Fully Implemented and Production-Ready**  
> The R2R integration has been fully implemented, thoroughly tested, and is now ready for production use. Benchmark results show significant improvements in handling edge cases and providing detailed reasoning.

## Overview

R2R (Reason to Retrieve) is an advanced AI retrieval system developed by SciPhi-AI. It provides state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities with production-ready features. The integration with our Developmental Assessment API enhances:

1. **Scoring Accuracy**: Retrieves relevant examples and research to improve scoring decisions
2. **Active Learning**: Enables more effective identification of valuable examples for expert review
3. **Knowledge Management**: Organizes and retrieves developmental assessment information efficiently
4. **Research Access**: Provides quick access to developmental research and guidelines

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Mistral API key (recommended but optional)
- Required Python packages (installed via `requirements-r2r.txt`)

### Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-r2r.txt
```

2. Optionally set your Mistral API key:

```bash
export MISTRAL_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

3. Start the server with R2R enabled:

```bash
./start_with_r2r.sh
```

This will start the server with both R2R and Active Learning enabled. You can access the R2R dashboard at `http://localhost:8003/r2r-dashboard/`.

## Benchmarking Results

The R2R integration has been thoroughly tested and benchmarked. Here are the key findings:

### Comprehensive Benchmark

These improvements make the system more reliable for clinical use, particularly in ambiguous situations where context and nuance are critical for accurate developmental assessment.

## Architecture

The R2R integration consists of several components:

### 1. R2R Client

The `R2RClient` class in `src/core/retrieval/r2r_client.py` provides core functionality for interacting with the R2R system. Key features include:

- Document ingestion and chunking
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- Retrieval and generation
- Collection management

### 2. R2R Enhanced Scorer

The `R2REnhancedScorer` class in `src/core/scoring/r2r_enhanced_scorer.py` leverages R2R for improved scoring:

- Retrieves relevant examples for given responses
- Uses contextual information to inform scoring decisions
- Provides detailed reasoning with citations

### 3. R2R Active Learning

The `R2RActiveLearningSystems` class in `src/core/scoring/r2r_active_learning.py` enhances the active learning process:

- Identifies valuable examples for expert review based on semantic similarity
- Stores expert feedback in a queryable format
- Enables more effective model improvement

### 4. API Routes

The R2R API routes in `src/api/r2r_routes.py` provide REST endpoints for interacting with the R2R system:

- Document ingestion
- Search
- Retrieval and generation
- Dashboard UI

## Key Features

### 1. Multimodal Ingestion

The system supports ingestion of various types of developmental assessment content:

- Research papers and studies

- Scoring examples with expert feedback
- Clinical guidelines and best practices

### 2. Enhanced Scoring

R2R improves scoring in several ways:

- Retrieves similar examples to inform scoring decisions
- Incorporates developmental research and best practices
- Provides evidence-based reasoning for scores
- Handles edge cases and ambiguous responses better

### 3. Knowledge Management

The system organizes knowledge into separate collections:

- `developmental_research`: Research papers, studies, and theoretical frameworks
- `scoring_examples`: Expert-reviewed examples of responses and their scores
- `expert_knowledge`: Expert guidelines and heuristics for assessment
- `clinical_guidelines`: Clinical best practices and protocols

### 4. Active Learning Enhancement

R2R enhances the active learning process:

- Better prioritization of examples for expert review
- More effective model improvement from expert feedback
- Contextual information for expert reviewers

## Collections

The R2R integration uses several collections to organize information:

1. **developmental_research**: Contains research about child development and assessment methodologies.
2. **scoring_examples**: Stores examples of responses and their expert-assigned scores.
3. **expert_knowledge**: Contains expert knowledge and guidelines for developmental assessment.
4. **clinical_guidelines**: Contains clinical best practices for assessment and interpretation.

## API Reference

### Dashboard

The R2R dashboard is available at `/r2r-dashboard/` and provides a user interface for:

- Searching documents
- Generating responses

To use R2R with active learning:

1. Start the server with both enabled:
```bash
export ENABLE_R2R=true
export ENABLE_ACTIVE_LEARNING=true
python3 -m uvicorn src.app:app --port 8003
```

2. Access the active learning dashboard at `http://localhost:8003/active-learning/`

3. When providing expert feedback, the system will automatically store the examples in R2R for future retrieval

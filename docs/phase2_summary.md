# Knowledge Engineering Module - Phase 2 Summary

## Overview

Phase 2 of the Knowledge Engineering module focused on implementing domain-specific prompts for the LLM-based scorer. This enhancement allows the scoring system to leverage specialized knowledge about different developmental domains (Motor, Communication, Social, and Cognitive) to improve the accuracy and reliability of assessments.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Domain-Specific Prompt Templates**
   - Created JSON-based prompt templates for each developmental domain
   - Implemented specialized guidance for each domain
   - Developed domain-specific descriptions for each scoring category

2. **Integration with LLM Scorer**
   - Enhanced the LLM scorer to use domain-specific prompts
   - Implemented fallback to standard prompts when domain-specific ones are not available
   - Added configuration options to enable/disable domain-specific prompts

3. **Knowledge Engineering Framework**
   - Implemented functions to load and format domain-specific prompts
   - Created a system for managing and validating prompt templates
   - Established a directory structure for storing and organizing templates

4. **Benchmarking and Evaluation**
   - Developed a benchmarking framework to compare performance with and without domain-specific prompts
   - Evaluated accuracy, confidence, and processing time across different domains
   - Generated detailed reports and metrics for analysis

5. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the Knowledge Engineering module
   - Developed example scripts to demonstrate the use of domain-specific prompts
   - Provided usage guidelines and best practices

## Performance Impact

Based on benchmarking results, domain-specific prompts have shown:

- **Accuracy**: Improved accuracy for cognitive and motor domains
- **Confidence**: Consistent high confidence across domains
- **Processing Time**: Slight increase in processing time (approximately 2 seconds per sample)

## Domain-Specific Enhancements

### Motor Domain
- Focus on quality and consistency of movement patterns
- Assessment of physical assistance needs
- Consideration of environmental adaptations

### Communication Domain
- Evaluation of frequency and consistency of communication attempts
- Analysis of initiation vs. response patterns
- Assessment of communication functions and modalities

### Social Domain
- Focus on interest in and engagement with others
- Evaluation of interaction initiation
- Assessment of social reciprocity and joint attention

### Cognitive Domain
- Analysis of problem-solving approaches
- Evaluation of curiosity and exploration
- Assessment of memory and learning application

## Implementation Details

1. **File Structure**
   ```
   config/prompt_templates/
   ├── motor_template.json
   ├── communication_template.json
   ├── social_template.json
   └── cognitive_template.json
   ```

2. **Core Components**
   - `format_prompt_with_context`: Formats a prompt template with milestone context
   - `load_prompt`: Loads a prompt template from a file
   - `_get_domain_specific_template`: Retrieves a domain-specific template

3. **Configuration Options**
   ```json
   {
     "use_domain_specific_prompts": true,
     "custom_templates_dir": "config/prompt_templates"
   }
   ```

## Future Directions

1. **Fine-tuning**: Further refinement of domain-specific prompts based on expert feedback
2. **Milestone-Specific Prompts**: More granular prompts for specific milestone types
3. **Age-Specific Guidance**: Incorporate age-specific considerations into prompts
4. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Better handling of milestones that span multiple domains
5. **Multilingual Support**: Templates for multiple languages

## Conclusion

Phase 2 of the Knowledge Engineering module has successfully implemented domain-specific prompts for the LLM-based scorer. This enhancement provides a more nuanced and accurate assessment of developmental milestones across different domains. The system is now better equipped to understand the specific context and requirements of each developmental domain, leading to more reliable and informative assessments.

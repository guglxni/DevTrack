# Category Refinement Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the practical steps to refine our scoring category system based on the developmental psychology literature review. The goal is to strengthen the theoretical foundation of our assessment framework and improve the accuracy of our scoring engine.

## Phase 1: Category Definition Refinement (1-2 weeks)

### Tasks

1. **Update Category Definitions**
   - [ ] Revise scoring category definitions in `src/core/scoring/base.py` to align with research-backed definitions
   - [ ] Add detailed comments with citations to document the research basis
   - [ ] Ensure definition alignment across all components of the system

2. **Refine Domain-Specific Category Rubrics**
   - [ ] Update the category rubrics in `src/core/knowledge/developmental_domains.py`
   - [ ] Implement domain-specific indicators based on literature review
   - [ ] Add research-based transition indicators between categories

3. **Create Category Decision Trees**
   - [ ] Develop structured decision paths for category assignment in each domain
   - [ ] Document the evidence-based criteria for each decision point
   - [ ] Implement as helper functions for more accurate category assignment

## Phase 2: Prompt Template Enhancement (1-2 weeks)

### Tasks

1. **Update Domain-Specific Prompt Templates**
   - [ ] Revise all templates in `config/prompt_templates/` with research-backed language
   - [ ] Add specific evidence indicators from established assessment frameworks
   - [ ] Include category boundary definitions for more precise scoring

2. **Enhance Category Descriptions in Templates**
   - [ ] Update category descriptions to reflect domain-specific nuances
   - [ ] Add examples that illustrate key distinctions based on research
   - [ ] Include evidence indicators from standardized assessments

3. **Implement Evidence-Based Confidence Thresholds**
   - [ ] Update confidence calculations in `src/core/scoring/confidence_tracker.py`
   - [ ] Implement the literature-based thresholds (>0.80, 0.60-0.80, <0.60)
   - [ ] Add documentation explaining the research basis for thresholds

## Phase 3: Knowledge Base Integration (1-2 weeks)

### Tasks

1. **Create Central Knowledge Repository**
   - [ ] Implement a new module `src/core/knowledge/category_knowledge.py`
   - [ ] Structure evidence-based category distinctions by domain
   - [ ] Include research citations and references

2. **Integrate Standardized Assessment Mappings**
   - [ ] Create mappings between our categories and established assessments
   - [ ] Document equivalence to AEPS, ASQ-3, Bayley-4, and DAYC-2 scales
   - [ ] Implement functions to translate between different scoring systems

3. **Develop Age-Specific Category Variations**
   - [ ] Create age-bracketed category descriptions (0-12, 12-24, 24-36 months)
   - [ ] Document typical developmental trajectories for each category
   - [ ] Implement age-appropriate scoring adjustments

## Phase 4: Validation and Testing (2-3 weeks)

### Tasks

1. **Update Test Data with Research-Based Examples**
   - [ ] Review and revise test cases in `src/testing/gold_standard_manager.py`
   - [ ] Add examples that match standardized assessment criteria
   - [ ] Include edge cases that test category boundaries

2. **Implement Enhanced Benchmarking**
   - [ ] Create a new benchmark script `src/testing/category_validation_benchmark.py`
   - [ ] Add metrics for alignment with established assessment frameworks
   - [ ] Test category boundary precision with literature-based examples

3. **Expert Review Process**
   - [ ] Prepare validation protocol with developmental specialists
   - [ ] Compare category assignments with expert judgments
   - [ ] Document concordance with established assessment tools

## Phase 5: Documentation and Integration (1 week)

### Tasks

1. **Update Knowledge Engineering Documentation**
   - [ ] Revise documentation in `src/core/knowledge/README.md`
   - [ ] Add section on research foundation for category distinctions
   - [ ] Document evidence-based confidence thresholds

2. **Create Developer Guidelines**
   - [ ] Document best practices for category assignment
   - [ ] Create examples that illustrate category boundaries
   - [ ] Provide guidance for handling edge cases

3. **Update API Documentation**
   - [ ] Revise category descriptions in API documentation
   - [ ] Add confidence threshold explanations
   - [ ] Document domain-specific category variations

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1-2 | Category Definition Refinement | Updated category definitions, domain-specific rubrics |
| 3-4 | Prompt Template Enhancement | Research-aligned templates, updated category descriptions |
| 5-6 | Knowledge Base Integration | Central repository, assessment mappings, age variations |
| 7-9 | Validation and Testing | Enhanced test data, benchmarking, expert validation |
| 10 | Documentation and Integration | Updated docs, developer guidelines, API documentation |

## Required Resources

1. **Development Resources**
   - 1-2 developers familiar with the scoring system
   - 1 researcher with developmental psychology background
   - Access to cited literature for reference

2. **Testing Resources**
   - Gold standard dataset with clearly categorized examples
   - Validation protocol for expert review
   - Benchmarking framework with standardized metrics

3. **External Expertise**
   - Consultation with developmental specialist (5-10 hours)
   - Review by clinical psychologist with assessment experience (3-5 hours)

## Success Criteria

1. **Alignment with Research**
   - >90% concordance with established assessment frameworks
   - Clear documentation of research basis for all category definitions
   - Expert validation of domain-specific category distinctions

2. **Technical Performance**
   - Improved accuracy in category boundary cases (>15% improvement)
   - More consistent confidence scores across domains
   - Reduced need for expert review of borderline cases

3. **Documentation Quality**
   - Comprehensive documentation of research foundation
   - Clear guidelines for developers and researchers
   - Traceable citations for all category definitions and thresholds

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Integration Challenges**
   - Plan incremental updates to minimize disruption
   - Create compatibility layer for backward compatibility
   - Extensive testing of each component before full integration

2. **Resource Constraints**
   - Prioritize highest-impact changes first
   - Consider phased implementation if resources are limited
   - Focus initial efforts on domains with greatest need for refinement

3. **Validation Gaps**
   - Identify key examples for each category boundary
   - Supplement with literature examples where test data is limited
   - Consider synthetic data generation for under-represented cases
